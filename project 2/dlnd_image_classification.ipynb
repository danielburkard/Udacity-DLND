You'll preprocess the images, then train a convolutional neural network on all the samples. The images need to be normalized and the labels need to be one-hot encoded.  You'll get to apply what you learned and build a convolutional, max pooling, dropout, and fully connected layers.  At the end, you'll get to see your neural network's predictions on the sample images.\n",

However, you might notice people are getting scores [well above 70%](http://rodrigob.github.io/are_we_there_yet/build/classification_datasets_results.html#43494641522d3130).  That's because we haven't taught you all there is to know about neural networks. We still need to cover a few more techniques.\n",
